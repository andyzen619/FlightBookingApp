Planning Meeting 1 (2015-11-09)
Current State of the Project
	- Initial meeting no work yet completed
	Done at meeting: 
	- CRC model, both groups had similar design. Attempted 	to merge designs to maximize modularity and extensability.
	- Assigned responsibilities to individual members.
	- Set status meeting for Wed at 1:00pm.

Tasks for this week (to be completed for Fri Nov 13):
	- Implement User (parent), Client (child of User) and Administrator (child of User) classes. Note all 3 classes must be serializable, and throw exception if incorrect data is inputted. (Raphael)
	- Implement Transportation (parent) and Flight (child of Transportation) classes. Note both classes must be serializable, and throw exception if incorrect data is inputted.(Andy)
	- Implement FlightDatabase (2D hashmap graph (adjacency list), mapping origin to a list or set of Flights leaving from that origin). Note must be serializable. (Ian)
	- Implement Itinerary Generator (Finds all valid paths fromorigin to destination). (Ian)
	- Implement Itinerary Sort (in place Merge sort). (Zain)
	- Implement Itinerary class. Note must be serializable.(Zain)
	- Implement the child of Itinerary FlightItinerary. (Zain)
	- Implement Flight Booking Application (Books flight for client, adds passenger to booked flights, checks that flights are not overbooked before booking). (John)
	- Implement System/Drive class (load/save user and flight data using serialization, login client or administrator (hashmap mapping usernames to Users)). (John)



Status Meeting 1 (2015-11-11)
Group:
	- Discussed implimentation of transportation and flight class.
	- Agreed to remove flight capacity as no mention of it is made in the handout.
	- Agreed to rename crc driver class to system to prevent conflict with driver class that will be used for testing.
	- Discussed package design based on class discussion, may make minor changes to current design on Fri-Sat once all classes are implimented.
Andy:
	- Started implimentation of Transportation and Flight classes.
	- Will change variable types as decided by group (remove static and transient).
	- Will redo getter/setters to match group format.
	- Will add full documentation to classes and class methods.
	- Will make all classes checkstyle compliant.
	- Will remove flight capacity, passenger list, etc.
	- Will impliment algorithm to calculate travel time.
Ian:
	- Will start implimenting classes today, and finish before Friday as per schedule.
	- Will impliment FlightDatabase and ItineraryGenerator.
	- Will complete FlightDatabase by Thurs, and ItineraryGenerator by end of Fri or before.
	- Will update crc design on Friday with changes/improvements found during implimentation.
	- Will add data.txt explaining data structures by/on Saturday once all class implimentation is finalized.
Zain:
	- Started implimentation on Itinerary and FlightItinerary classes.
	- Will add FlightItinerary constructor from list of Flights.
	- Will impliment sorting algorithm for FlightItineraries by time and cost (discussed in-place sorting using merge-sort).
John:
	- Will impliment classes before/on Friday as per schedule.
	- Will now create a seperate class for loading and saving to disk using serialization, instead of implementing in system class as in original design.
Raphael:
	- Will impliment classes before/on Friday as per schedule.
	- Classes are still unchanged as in original design.

Status Meeting 2 (2015-11-13)
Group:
	- Disscussed any changes that needed to be made to the design and implementation of the class.
	- Invloved talking about raising exceptions 

Andy: 
	- Take Parse Exception from travelTime to constructor
	- Will implement Java docs for his assigned classes
	- Will change the formatting of the date to match the one in the file as decided by the group
	- Will change protected variables to private variable
	- Also will move private travelTime variable from private class variable to method variable 
Zain: 
	- Will implement a method to return Itinerary information
	- Change the ItinerarySort to static methods so that they can be accessed without the object creation
	- Combine Itinerary and FlightIntinerary into one class for better functionality for searching Itineraries (design decision by the group)
Raphael:
	- Implemented uploadClinet information method
	- Will implement upload flight information by adminstrator
	- Also will implement serialization
	- throw exceptions to files not in correct format
John:
	- Will commit his files by Friday
	- Will implement the rest of his methods in the Drive class
Ian: 
	- Will add an exception to his FlightDatabse
	- Implement Flight searc
	- Itinerary search is started and will be finished by Friday night
	- Start implementation of system class to combine/pass data between classes
